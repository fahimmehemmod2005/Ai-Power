1. Purpose of this Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how Clamea AB collects, uses, and protects personal data processed through our AI-based insurance advisory application (“the App”). We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and applicable Swedish data protection laws. The App is designed to help users understand their insurance terms, assess potential compensation rights, and receive general guidance — without Clamea acting as a legal representative or submitting claims to insurance companies.

2. Data We Collect

When you use the App, we may collect the following types of personal data:

 • Identity Data: name, email address, and phone number.  
 • Account Data: login credentials, language preferences, and settings.  
 • User-Provided Data: uploaded documents, photos, and descriptions of injuries.  
 • AI Interaction Data: messages and questions submitted to our AI assistant and the generated responses.  
 • Technical Data: IP address, device type, operating system, app version, and crash logs.  
 • Payment Data: for premium subscriptions, payments are handled by third-party providers (Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe). We do not store or process your card details.

We do not collect national identification numbers, medical records, or financial data directly from healthcare providers or insurance companies.

3. Purpose of Processing

We process personal data to:

 • Provide insurance guidance and advisory services through the App’s AI system.  
 • Help users interpret their insurance coverage and compensation eligibility.  
 • Store and display documents uploaded by the user.  
 • Manage premium accounts and payment processing.  
 • Improve the AI model and enhance user experience (using anonymized data).  
 • Fulfill legal obligations under Swedish law.

4. Legal Basis for Processing

We process your personal data based on:

 • Consent: when you register and use the App.  
 • Contract: necessary for providing the requested services.  
 • Legal Obligation: to comply with applicable laws.  
 • Legitimate Interest: to maintain and improve app functionality and security.

5. AI and Automated Decision Support

The App’s AI assistant provides advisory and informational support only. It does not make legally binding decisions or replace professional advice.  
All AI training is done using anonymized data. Personal information is never used for training without explicit consent.

6. Data Storage and Security

 • All data is stored on secure servers within the EU/EEA.  
 • Communications are encrypted using TLS/SSL.  
 • Only authorized Clamea personnel can access stored data.  
 • You may request export or deletion of your data at any time.

7. Data Retention

 • Account Information: retained while your account is active.  
 • Uploaded Documents: retained until deleted by you or upon account termination.  
 • AI Conversations: anonymized and stored for up to 6 months to improve performance.  
 • Payment Information: not stored by Clamea but by third-party providers.

Personal data is permanently deleted within 60 days after account closure.

8. Data Sharing

We do not share your personal information with insurance companies, authorities, or third parties without your explicit consent. Exceptions apply only when required by law or a court order. Any third-party providers must comply with GDPR.

9. Third-Party Integrations and APIs

If you choose to share insurance data via an integration such as the Insurely API, your data will be processed according to that provider’s privacy policy. All integrations follow GDPR requirements.

10. Children and Minors

The App is intended for users aged 18 and above.  
We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors. If such data is discovered, it will be deleted immediately.

11. Your Rights

Under GDPR, you may:

 • Request access  
 • Request deletion or correction  
 • Withdraw consent  
 • Restrict processing  
 • File a complaint with the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY)

Contact: info@clamea.se

12. Cookies and Usage Data

The App may use cookies or similar technologies to enhance user experience, store preferences, and analyze performance. You may disable cookies in your device settings.

13. Transfers Outside the EU/EEA

Your personal data will not be transferred outside the EU/EEA without adequate safeguards in place.

14. Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Users will be notified in the App or via email before significant changes take effect.
